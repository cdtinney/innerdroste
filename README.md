# innerdroste

Static web app that applies the `innerdroste` effect to an uploaded image to mimic the album artwork of [Tame Impala's Innerspeaker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innerspeaker) which features the [Droste effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droste_effect) (does the name make sense now?).

Deployed statically via GitHub pages.

## Dependencies
