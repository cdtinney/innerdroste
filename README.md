# innerdroste

Static web app that applies the `innerdroste` effect to an uploaded image to mimic the album artwork of [Tame Impala's Innerspeaker]((https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innerspeaker) which features the [Droste effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Droste_effect) (does the name make sense now?).

It leverages [Konva.js](https://konvajs.github.io/), an awesome HTML5 2D canvas library, to do so.

Deployed statically via GitHub pages.
